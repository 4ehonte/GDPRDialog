Following is important (talked with a lawyer I know of who is a GDPR specialist). I'm no lawyer, so don't take everything I write for granted. Check out the the [EU GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/) yourself for more informations.

To be on the safe side, I can give following advices:

* you are from within the EAA => show the dialog to anyone, not only to people from within the EAA
* you are from outside the EAA
  * you offer your product inside the EAA => show the dialog to anyone, not only to people from within the EAA
  * you do *not* offer your product inside the EAA => you don't need to show the dialog to anyone, so actually you don't need this library at all
* ask the user for the age explicitly (decide yourself here, I will do it implicitly but explicitly would be the way the industry is doing it in real life)
