### GDPR - General informations

Following are some tipps I got from a GDPR specialist.

To be on the safe side, I can give following advices:

* you are from within the EAA => show the dialog to anyone, not only to people from within the EAA
* you are from outside the EAA
  * you offer your product inside the EAA => show the dialog to anyone, not only to people from within the EAA
  * you do *not* offer your product inside the EAA => you don't need to show the dialog to anyone, so actually you don't need this library at all
* ask the user for the age explicitly (decide yourself here, I will do it implicitly but explicitly would be the way the industry is doing it in real life)

In general, 

* ...consent must be given freely, the user must know this
* ...you can't punish a user for not giving consent
* ...you must inform the user that he can change his mind and withdraw his consent at any time
* ...you must inform the user about each service you use and link the corresponding privacy policy when asking the user for consent

*Again, I'm no lawyer, so don't take anything I write for granted*. Check out the [EU GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/) yourself for more informations.
